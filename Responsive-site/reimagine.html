      <p>When I decided to create this site I had to explain my goal to my friends. Many didn't understand why I was encouraging others to reuse candle containers.  The amount of waste created from candle containers do not rival water bottles, but they are not as recyclable.  Especially glass containers with tinted or colored glass.  This is why I consider a few things before purchasing a candle:  Is the container recyclable, will I reuse this container for another candle, can i reimagine this container as anything else besides a candle. The answer is usually,"I can reimagine this container with another scent".  Sorry, that wasn't one of the questions I ask myself, but it is the usual answer.  If you are like me, you have searched high and low on the internet to find out how to reuse a container reimagined.  You may find a lot of ideas on Pinterest, but no real answers about how to do it.  It makes me wonder if it is prohibited.  If I purchased a 3-wick candle soy candle, why can't I remake a 3-wick soy candle.  No one really wants to provide instructions on how to remake a candle because there are too many variables.  The original manufacturer may have used a soy blend that keeps the heating temperature down to prevent the container from overheating. You may decide to use paraffin or beeswax and cause major damage.  Please be mindful of the type of candles you buy and stick with the same type for refills.  As for me, I like to make custom candles to fit my old containers.  I also like to hand pour my own aromatherapy candles.  Reimagining great work is what I like to do, and if you are interested in breathing new life into a candle that has lost its light join me on this journey of candles in the making: Reinvent, Reimagine, Reilluminate. </p>
