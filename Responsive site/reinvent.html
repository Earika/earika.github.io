        <p>In order to reuse your favorite container you must first remove the old wax residue.  There are many ways to do this, I like to use hot water from my tea kettle. </p>

    <ul>

      <li>Step 1:
	        Bring water to a boil in a kettle (a small pot can be used if you do not have a kettle).</li>

      <li>Step 2:
	        Use a spatula or a butter knife to remove as much wax from around the inside of the container.</li>

      <li>Step 3: (optional)
	        If you are using a container with a wide bottom and narrow opening make an "X" imprint the wax bottom as deep as you can. Do not force, as we do not want to distroy the container.</li>

     <li>Step 4:
	       Place the container on a flat surface with a heat resistant cloth under it. For your protection.</li>

    <li>Step 5:
	      Fill the container with the hot water half way.  Let sit for 20 minutes or until the wax 	begins to float to the top. </li>

    <li>Step 6: Remove floating wax from water, pour water out, and wipe container down with candle wax remover (i.e., De-Solv-it!)</li>
