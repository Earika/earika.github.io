          <p>Someone bought a candle for me as a gift for Christmas.  It came in a beautiful burgandy and silver tin container, and had a delightful scent.  I went home and lit it immediately.  The scent lit up the place very nicely. Unfortunately, it burned way faster than i am used too.  The beautiful tin container was still in great condition and I didn't want to throw it away. I usually have this problem with flower vases, which is why i have an overwhelming amount of them. So i pondered,"what can I do with this beautiful container?".  I decided to repurpose it.  But how? I wasn't sure if I wanted to make another candle or just use the beautiful container for something else.  Since it was a tin container and I loved the way the light hit the sides of the container and reflected on various walls in the room.  It was unpredictable.  A decision was made. I cleaned the wax from the container and replaced it with a 3-wick pillar candle.  Once I measured it and cut it down to fit the container it was perfect.  I spent less than $10 to reimagine and recreate another candle that I love.  I kind of love it a little more since I reimagined it with one of my favorite long-burning highly scented candles.
